								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">What is Search Engine Optimization?</h2></p>
								<p>It is the process of getting traffic from the “free” or “natural” search results on search engines. It is also the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.</p>

								<br>
								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">Guidlines on how to read a Search Engine Result Page</h2></p>
								<b>1. Previewing pages</b>
                				<p>
                  				Notice that when you use your mouse to point at a particular search result, called aresult block, a small, sideways chevron appears next to it (). Clicking on that chevron allows you to preview a document, letting you determine what kind of document is behind the link. It can help you decide whether that link meets your needs, and whether you want to visit the page.These previews, in combination with skimming results, can help you get a quick grounding in a subject.</p>
				                <b>2. Understanding an individual search result</b>
				                <p>Result blocks on a search results page consist of three major elements:</p>
				                <u>Title</u>: The blue link in the top line gives you the topic of the page.
				                <br><br>
				                <u>Web address/URL</u>: The second line contains a green link which tells you location of the document on the web. This line can help you determine the source of the information.
				                <br><br>
				                <u>Snippet</u>: This last two lines, the black text, show you some of the places where your search terms appear on the page, embedded in the text in which they appear. A snippet is not a complete summary of the text on a page; it is only search terms in context, extracted from the document.
				                <br><br><br>
				                <b>3. Using an entire results page</b>
				                <p>
				                Not only is it helpful to know how to understand a single result, but you can gain a lot from taking a moment to look over an entire screen or page full of results.</p>
				                <br>


								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">How SEO Affects Business?</h2></p>
								<p>Increase your website's visibility on search engines like Google and Bing and attract the right kind of traffic to the right pages on your site. Learn about search engine optimization including how to read a results page, find your ranking, and see how rankings affect businesses large and small.</p>

								<br>

								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">List some important SEO Expectations</h2></p>
								<p><b>*Set realistic goals*</b>
					            A myriad of elements affect position with the search engines, and moving toward those top listings takes time and effort. You understand this, but do your stakeholders? Although SEO is an effective long-term investment, its results are not instantaneous like those of PPC. Setting realistic expectations out of the gate about how search engines work and the types of results you can realistically expect to achieve will do wonders in shaping perception.
					            <br>
					            Ask your SEO partner to provide detail that you can easily pass on to your stakeholders to help them understand the ins and outs.
					            You know that you can’t just “move” your organic listing to page one. Make sure the person who approves your budget understands that as well.
					            </p>

					            <p><b>*Pulling it together*</b>
					            The longevity of your SEO Campaign is based on a multitude of factors that are typically rolled up into two outcomes – success or failure. Setting realistic goals, measuring your performance towards those goals over time and identifying conversion points all help paint an accurate picture of your SEO campaign.
					            <br>
				                Setting and managing expectations – your own as well as those of your stakeholders – will work wonders as you move through your SEO Program and prove your value.
					            </p>

					            <p><b>*Set a baseline*</b>
					            One element of measuring success in any SEO campaign is time. Now that you’ve established your Calls to Action and identified all conversion points along the way, setting a baseline to measure progress over time couldn’t be more important.
					            <br>
					            Remember that search engines need some time to index your newly revamped web pages. Month to month comparisons tend to provide more realistic insight than day to day dips and spikes. Although daily changes can be interesting (and even slightly addictive) to note, be cautious in your reactions. Stay true to your SEO plan to understand the month to month implications of your SEO efforts. Don’t pull the plug on a well-thought SEO plan if you noticed a slight dip yesterday in the SERPs after you changed your heading tags.

								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">What is the Difference Between SEO and SEM?</h2></p>
								<p>The difference between SEO and SEM is simply that Search Engine Optimization is part of Search engine marketing or Search marketing as it is widely known. Both processes aim in increasing visibility in search engines.</p>

								<br>
								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">SEO Strategies</h2></p>
								<b>1. Domain Name Strategy</b>
                				<p>
                  				The purpose of a domain name strategy is to proactively protect your brand online by reducing the chance for others to use your brand name in their online activities, specifically, in their website URLs.</p>
				                <b>2. Link Building Strategy</b>
                				<p>
                  				Linking strategy refers to the process of getting external pages to link to a page on your website.</b>
				                <p>
				                <b>3. Keyword Strategy</b>
                				<br>
                  				Your keyword strategy should involve selecting high-performing keywords that drive relevant traffic to your business. Choosing the right keywords for advertising can make all the difference in your campaigns, determining how well your advertisements rank on Google and other search engine platforms.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>4. Title Tags Strategy</b>
                  				Title tags are part of the meta tags that appear at the top of your HTML inside the < head> area. Think of title tags like the title of the chapter of a book. It tells people and search engines what your page is about.Title tags are also part of what makes people decide whether to visit your site when it shows up in the search results. The title tag should contain important keywords to help the search engine determine what the page is about.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>5. Meta Description Tags Strategy</b>
				                <br>
                  				Meta elements are HTML or XHTML elements used to provide information about a web page for the search engines and website users. A well-written meta description can give your site an advantage in search engine results pages (SERPs), resulting in more click-throughs to your site where you have more chances to convert that visitor into a lead or new customer.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>6. Alt Tags Strategy</b>
				                <br>                				
                  				Alt tags make it possible for search engines to properly read and understand what an image is conveying. In other words, it’s one more element on your site for search engines to crawl and another chance for you to infuse your keywords (assuming the image is relevant to your keywords). It will also help you think more strategically about the images on your page to make sure you’re maximizing your targeted keywords.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>7. Search Engine Indexing Strategy</b>
                				<br>
                  				Search engine indexing is the process of a search engine collecting, parses and stores data for use by the search engine. The actual search engine index is the place where all the data the search engine has collected is stored. It is the search engine index that provides the results for search queries, and pages that are stored within the search engine index that appear on the search engine results page.
				                <br><br><br>


								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">Is it possible to combine strategies? If yes, which strategies would like to implement? Why?</h2></p>
								<p>It is very possible since it is important to make a website that is competitive in the Internet. I would choose the domain name strategy and linking strategy; simply because through linking strategy, there is a way for the website to be competitive in the SEO marketing. And domain name strategy, a unique and catchy name is necessary to catch the attention of the users. With these strategies combined, the website will be much more effective on search engines and specially on marketing.</p>

								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">What is the Difference Between On-Page SEO and Off-page SEO?</h2></p>
								<p><b>On-page SEO</b> is the act of optimizing different parts of your web site that affect your search engine rankings. It's stuff that you have control over and can change on your own website. On-page SEO ensures that your site can be read by both potential customers and search engine robots. With good on-page SEO, search engines can easily index your web pages, understand what your site is about, and easily navigate the structure and content of your website, thus ranking your site accordingly. In short, it refers to all the things that you can do ON your website to help you rank higher, such as page titles, internal linking, meta tags & descriptions, etc.<br><br><b>Off-page SEO</b> focuses on increasing the authority of your domain through the act of getting links from other websites.  If you start filling the site with links, your pages are all going to rise to the top.  This is how a site like Wikipedia ranks for pretty much everything under the sun. There's a score called "Domain Authority" that calculates how authoritative your website is compared to other sites. In short, it refers to all the things that you can do directly OFF your website to help you rank higher, such as social networking, article submission, forum & blog marketing, etc.</p>

								<br>
								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">ON-PAGE SEO Strategies</h2></p>
								<b>1. Page Titles</b>
                				<p>
                  				Your page titles are one of the most important SEO factors on your site. Each of your pages & posts should have its own unique title, which includes the main keywords for that page. This way, whenever someone searches for a certain page in a search engine, your post has a better chance of showing up because you have included those keywords.</p>
				                <b>2. Meta Descriptions</b>
                				<p>
                  				These descriptions are an important place to include relevant keywords for your content, as these are used within the search results when your page is listed. For instance, if we continue to use the page, then a good meta description for that page would include those keywords and related ones.</b>
				                <p>
				                <b>3. Meta Tags</b>
                				<br>
                  				For each of your pages, you can include a set of keywords in the form of meta tags. These should be all the relevant keywords of your content, which you will have researched previously.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>4. URL Structure</b>
                  				Including search engine friendly URLs for each of your pages is highly recommended, as these bring better crawling. Shorter URLs seem to perform better in search engine results, however that is not the only factor. URLs that include targeted keywords, also perform better. The location of these keywords can also be a major influence. 
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>5. Body Tags (H1, H2, H3, H4, etc.)</b>
				                <br>
                  				When writing your articles, you should break up your content into smaller sections & paragraphs to make it easier for people to read. These sections can be given heading, which is where H1, H2, H3, H4, etc. tags are used. Generally H1 tags are reserved for your main page title, with subsequent headings being issued H2, H3, etc. Search engines use these to determine what is important within your content. This is why keyword rich headines are more useful than generic ones. Make sure you write keyword rich headings in the order of priority in H1, H2 and H3 title tags. They are used by many crawlers to differentiate important content.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>6. Keyword Density</b>
				                <br>                				
                  				Including relevant keywords throughout your content is very important, as it helps search engines work out what your content is about. However, try not to excessively repeat and overuse keywords just for search engine robots. This can lead to your site being banned from search engines. To avoid this, try to keep your keyword density to roughly 2-5%. If you find this hard, get out a thesaurus and broaden your writing vocabulary. This way, you are still writing about the same thing, without risk of being banned.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>7. Image SEO</b>
                				<br>
                  				Using images within your content is a great way to make your site more visually appealing and break up boring chunks of text. You can utilise these images to help improve your site SEO. All your uploaded images have titles, so treat them just the same as your page titles. Including relevant keywords can help people find your site when searching on Google Images. You can also include Alt Text and Descriptions for your images, making them even more useful with SEO.
                  				<br><br>
                  				<b>8.  Internal Linking</b>
                  				<br>
                  				Placing links to your other website pages, is a great way of improving your site and used properly, internal links can be a useful weapon in your SEO arsenal. Not only does it make it much easier for your visitors to navigate around your site and find all of your content, but it also ensures that your site gets properly crawled allowing the search engines to find all of your pages. It also helps to build the relevancy of a page to relevant keywords and phrases, whilst also helping to increase the Google PageRank of your pages. There are a number of different methods that you can use to improve your internal linking structure. The main being; content links and permanent navigation links.		  
				                <br><br><br>


								<br>
								<p><h2 class="header center orange-text">OFF-PAGE SEO Strategies</h2></p>
								<b>1. Social Networking Sites</b>
                				<p>
                  				Social Networking is bigger than ever these days! Sometimes known as “Online Reputation Management”, getting involved with social media sites is the fundamental step with which you begin to advertise, market and build your online reputation within your niche. This allows you to extend your online network of contacts, to connect and interact with your friends, to share things with each other, and most importantly promote your website/blog and help build your online reputation.</p>
				                <b>2.  Blogging</b>
                				<p>
                  				Blogging is one of the best ways to promote your website online! By writing a blog for your website, you give a reason for visitors to keep returning to your site and keep up to date with your latest posts. It also helps search engines to crawl your site more frequently, as they have to update your latest blog post entries, which ultimately helps you rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).</b>
				                <p>
				                <b>3. Blog Marketing</b>
                				<br>
                  				Post comments on other blogs within the same niche as yours, which allow you to add a link in the comments section. These links can then be crawled by search engines, helping to point them towards your site.  These blogs are commonly referred to as “Do-Follow” Blogs.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>4. Forum Marketing</b>
                  				Find forums online that are related to your sites niche and get involved within that community. Reply to threads, answer peoples questions, offer advice, etc. This all helps to build up your reputation as someone who is an expert within that niche. Try to use “Do-Follow” Forums so that you can include a link to your site within your signature, which helps search engines crawl your site.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>5. Search Engine Submission</b>
				                <br>
                  				Search engines will eventually find your site online, but that can take a while. To speed everything up, you should submit your website to the most popular search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>6. Directory Submission</b>
				                <br>                				
                  				Many people may say that directory submission is dead! I believe that it isn’t as you are increasing the likely hood of people seeing your website. It is purely based on how effectively we are selecting those directories and how efficiently we are choosing the category for submission. You could submit to general directories, but for maximum effect, you are better off submitting to niche directories.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>7. Social Bookmarking</b>
                				<br>
                  				Social Bookmarking is another great way of promoting your website. Submit your latest blog posts and pages to the most popular bookmarking sites, like StumbleUpon, Digg, Delicious, Reddit, etc. Search engines really like these types of sites because the content on these sites is updated very frequently. This may increase your website traffic based on how effectively you have participated.
                  				<br><br>
                  				<b>8.  Link Baiting</b>
                  				<br>
                  				Link baiting is another popular way of promoting your site. If you produce a really popular unique post for your site, then other people may want to link to it. Perhaps you have copied/published another website’s content on your site, don’t forget to place their website link as a reference. Do it for others and, if your content is trustworthy, let others do it for you. This is another way to increase your link popularity.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>9. Photo Sharing</b>
				                <br>
                  				If you have used any of your own photos or images on your site, then you can share then on many of the major photo sharing websites like Flickr, Picasa, Photo Bucket, etc. Other people will be able to see them and comment on them, hopefully following a link to your site.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>10. Video Marketing</b>
				                <br>                				
                  				Just like photo sharing, if you have any videos that you have used on your site, then you can submit them to sites like; YouTube, Vimeo, etc. allowing people to find your content in other ways.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>11. Business Reviews</b>
                				<br>
                  				Write reviews about others businesses or ask your friends/clients to write a review of your business in major business review sites like RateitAll, Shvoong, Kaboodle, Stylefeeder, etc.
                  				<br><br>
                  				<b>12. Local Listings</b>
                  				<br>
                  				Depending on your site’s niche, you might find that listing in local directories may be useful. You may have a website promoting your local business, therefore instead of going global and facing huge competition, listing your website locally, so that search engines can easily view your website and fetch the content, will be much better. This will help you to reach a targeted audience. Submit your website to sites like; Google Local, Maps, Yahoo Local, Yellow Pages, etc.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>13. Article Submission</b>
				                <br>                				
                  				If you write your articles yourself, then you can submit them to popular article directory sites like; Ezine, Go Articles, Now Public, etc. This can help drive traffic to your site, whilst you can also gain some links to your site from other people.
                  				<br><br>
				                <b>14. Social Shopping Network</b>
                				<br>
                  				If you run an e-commerce website, then a good strategy for advertising and branding your products for free is to submit then to online shopping networks. By submitting your products to sites like; Google Product Search, Yahoo Online Shopping, MSN Online Shopping, and other major social shopping network sites like Kaboodle, Style Feeder, etc. then you increase the likelihood of people finding the products that you are selling.
                  				<br><br>
                  				<b>15. Answer Questions</b>
                  				<br>
                  				You can actively participate in answering questions on sites like Yahoo Answers. By answering and asking relevant questions on your site niche, you help to build up your reputation as someone that is an expert in your chosen field. You can place a link to your website in the source section if necessary so that people can easily find your site. If you don’t spam, this is another great way to increase your link popularity.
